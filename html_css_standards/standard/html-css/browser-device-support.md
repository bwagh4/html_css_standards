## Design Accuracy

Surgical precision is expected when recreating our static design assets into dynamic websites. While RWD makes this more challenging, you can still test for visual accuracy at the breakpoints provided in the comps.

Test the accuracy of your work as part of your everyday workflow. You can easily test how accurate the website is in relation to the initial design assets in any environment using the following steps:

* Take a screenshot in the browser.
* Paste the screenshot as the top layer in the design asset.
* Drop the opacity of the screenshot to 50%.
* Invert the colors of the screenshot.
* Everything that matches turns a 50% grey and "disappears" from view while the remaining artifacts that are misplaced generally turn hot pink and neon blue.

## Testing

Test all required browsers and devices early and often. A feature is not considered complete until it is tested natively in all required browser and device environments.
